Web-Logbook
===========

Web Logbook is an electronic web-based logbook. Main features include single
GUI, multi-language, attachments, archives, simple users management, sort,
user defined banners, search, import/export, trends and statistics. Good for
small to medium teams.

Some time ago while working in a network security group, we had a simple web
logbook where all important actions were registred. I always though I could
do more to make that logbook more functional and faster. As a result this
little project started.

Most features have not been exhaustively tested. If you find any bugs,
please let me know at <weblogbook (at) morgado (dot) ch>

Not all languages are supported (at least not yet!) You should disable them
in the configuration file. Also, English is not my mother tonge so I hope my
text isn't too bad.

Images have been 'stolen' from some places without asking their owners
(which I have no idea who they are?!). Maybe there are some copyright
restrictions regarding the use of this content -- if so, please apologise
and let me know how such issues can be solved. Thank you!
