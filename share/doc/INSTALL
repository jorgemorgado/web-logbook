The installation process is made to be quick and painless.
Only Perl and core modules should be required.

1. Extract the application onto your Web server's document root:

   $ gzip -d logbook-x.yz.tar.gz
   $ tar xvf logbook-x.yz.tar

   By default the application extracts to './logbook' directory. You can
   still change this in the logbook.cfg configuration file.


2. Modify the configuration:

   $ vi ./logbook/share/etc/logbook.cfg


3. Edit your web-server's configuration. On Apache would be something like:

   ScriptAlias /logbook/cgi-bin/ "/webserver/real/path/htdocs/logbook/cgi-bin/"
   <Directory "/webserver/real/path/htdocs/logbook/cgi-bin">
       AllowOverride None
       Options None
       Order allow,deny
       Allow from all
   </Directory>
   # prevents access to the 'share' directory
   <Directory "/webserver/real/path/htdocs/logbook/share">
       Deny from all
   </Directory>


4. Grant write access for your web server's user on the following directories:

   $ chown nobody ./logbook/share/attach
   $ chown nobody ./logbook/share/db


5. Reload/restart your webserver's configuration.


6. Using your browser go to: http://your.domain.here/logbook/cgi-bin/index.cgi
