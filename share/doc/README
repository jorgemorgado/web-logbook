Web Logbook README -- Jorge Morgado <jorge (at) morgado (dot) ch>
http://web-logbook.sourceforge.net

Web Logbook is just that - a logbook that runs over a web interface.

Some time ago while working in a network security group, we had a simple web
logbook where all important actions were registred. I always though I could
do more to make that logbook more functional and faster. As a result this
little project started.

Main features include:

* Written in Perl (no additional modules required)
* Easy management of several logbooks
* Multi-language
* Subjects list
* Attachements
* Auto-detect attach and view online
* Archive
* Search
* Sort
* Multi-page navigation
* Print view
* User input validation
* Statistics/trends
* Display URIs with a link
* Import/export
* Different logbook views (standard or groupped)
* Send email notifications when entries are added or changed

Most features have not been exhaustively tested. If you find any bugs,
please let me know at <weblogbook (at) morgado (dot) ch>

Not all languages are supported (at least not yet!) You should disable them
in the configuration file. Also, English is not my mother tonge so I hope my
text isn't too bad.

Images have been 'stolen' from some places without asking their owners
(which I have no idea who they are?!). Maybe there are some copyright
restrictions regarding the use of this content -- if so, please apologise
and let me know how such issues can be solved. Thank you!
