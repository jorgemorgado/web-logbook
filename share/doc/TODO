TODO:

* Users list per logbook
* Auto-archiving based on:
	a) date (ex: rotate the logbook every month or year)
* Web server authentication (username + password in config file)
* Once user auth is done, remove user drop-down and take logged in user
* XML export schema needs improvement
* Matrix view
* More AJAX

(add more entries to the above list :))             


BUGS:

(these are 'well-know' limitations but not serious ones - at least not for me)

- The Config object has a bug where wraping lines with '\' can be done
  only once per configuration line.

- The logbook might have some problems when _not_ running on Unix-like
  systems. Mostly, this is due to the Directory Separator being something
  different than / (slash). If you have such system, please let me know so
  that I can (try to) fix it.

- The Export/Import options are limited to logbook entries only. Attachment
  and Subject lists are not exported nor imported.
